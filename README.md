Banking Customer Churn Prediction
==============================

The objective of this project is to develop predictive models for customer churn in the banking industry. Maintaining a loyal customer base is a crucial aspect of business success, as the cost of acquiring new customers are typically higher than retaining existing ones. By identifying the factors that contribute to customer churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction. This project employs binary classification techniques, including logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost, to predict customer churn and determine the most influential predictors. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall, and the model with the lowest total error will be selected as the optimal model.
